		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>A hub for my written reports, published papers, programming projects, and links or topics of interest. My current papers are available in their original form as PDF, but they are also available here as HTML documents. Programming projects are prefaced with an about document included with a Github hosted Git repository with the code. If you are just looking for the gist of the programming projects, the about document is included on this website to save navigating over to Github.</p>
		
		<h2>Projects</h2>
		Some keywords have been added under each paper/project to aid in finding the most relevant topic.
		

		<h4>Solutions for Variable Ratio Coupler-Based Mach–Zehnder Interferometer</h4>
		<h5>&rarr;Physics &rarr;Optics &rarr;Research &rarr;Mathematics Analysis </h5>
		
		<h5>Abstract</h5>
		<p>An analytical method for achieving specific wave modulations from the device designed in <it>Polarization-Independent, Multifunctional All-Fiber Comb Filter Using Variable Ratio Coupler-Based Mach–Zehnder Interferometer</it> will be derived from the Jones calculus representing the device in question. This will, as a consequence, show the mathematical reasoning for many characteristics of the device such as the polarization-independence, and the ability to achieve the effects of a comb filter.</p>

		<h4>LÖVE Blackjack</h4>
		<h5>&rarr;Programming &rarr;Lua &rarr;Framework Scripting &rarr;Game</h5>
		<h5>About</h5>
		<p>A clone of Blackjack using the LÖVE 2D framework. The goal was to produce a quick prototype and Android application. The LÖVE 2D framework uses Lua scripting to the draw graphic interface and thus holds the game logic as well. A few iterations were explored using classic OOP objects for data structures, but it later changed to embrace a more procedural script paradigm.</p>

		<h4>Secular Long Periodic and High Frequency Semimajor Axis Time Rates of Change Due to
Emission of Gravitational Radiation</h4>
		<h5>&rarr;Physics &rarr;Celestial Mechanics &rarr;Numerical Analysis</h5>
		<h5>Abstract</h5>
		<p>For a two-body system, we derive expressions for the secular, long periodic and high frequency effects caused on to the semi-major axis of the secondary body due to the emission of gravitational waves. This is possible by considering the time rate of change of the total energy of the system, and substituting for the energy loss due the emission of gravitational waves. Next, we convert the time rate of change of the semimajor axis as a function of the orbital elements using standard a celestial mechanics approach, where the inverse powers or the orbital radial vector r is written as a function of the orbital elements with the help of the eccentricity functions G(e). We apply our result to Mercury/Sun system.</p>

		<h2>Related Interests</h2>
		<h4>Data-Oriented Design/Data-Oriented Programming</h4>
		<p>After working on some personal projects using the ingrained paradigm of object oriented programming, I found that I spent most of my time working at the abstractions of setting up objects, structures, etc rather than coding actual features. This lead me to a period where I then produced more of my code as procedural, but the long term handicap of large code bases and lack of unique data structures became apparent. From browsing current topics computer science, I found data oriented design. This paradigm is not as intuitive as the physical world based object oriented but I think the potential advantages for large and long term data management are worth it.</p>

		<h4>Solid State Solar Panels</h4>
		<p>This summer, as a diving point into applied solid state physics, I started to look at solar panels. Energy transformations were one of the main ideas that initially peaked my interest in physics. Along with the consideration of the current literal physical and business climates this topic fell right into my lap. Recent research into hybrid organic-inorganic Perovskite crystals being designed for ideal quantum electron energy levels has been where I have directed most of my exploration.</p>
